# WOWZERZ
A python based REPL, 100% RAM powered.
## What This Does:
- Allows you to run python code in many different ways.
- Has commands like `run`, `import`, and more.
- It's just a fun way of using the terminal.
## Setting This Up:
- No matter what your OS is, all you have to do is simply download the python file with everything you'll need.
- Make sure python is installed on your computer, and run it, it also works in online compilers if you don't want to install anything.
## Notes:
- This is still in its early stages.
- I'll try to add more commands, but I'll need feedback.
- This is mainly just for fun.
- This is extremely lightweight.
- I might make a version in rust, for better performance.
- I plan on adding an app installation feature that lets you install external apps made for WOWZERZ.
## Why This Is Kind Of Cool:
- It's currently less than 10KB, super lightweight.
- Fun to mess around with.
- Super easy to install and use.
## Its Features:
- The command `userscript` lets you run python code in a loop.
- You can make python files that aren't written to the disk, so no need for a huge hard drive, it's all in memory.
